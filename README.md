# Personalized Course Recommendation System  

## Introduction  
This project is a **Personalized Course Recommendation System** that uses **deep learning and embedding techniques** to recommend courses based on user interests. The model leverages **Generalized Matrix Factorization (GMF), Linear Multi-layer Factorization (LMF), and TF-IDF** to improve the accuracy and relevance of recommendations.  

## How It Works  
1. **User & Course Embeddings**  
   - Users and courses are mapped into a **16-dimensional space** to represent their features numerically.  
   - TF-IDF is used to generate embeddings for course categories, allowing the model to capture **semantic similarities** between courses.  

2. **Training Process**  
   - The model learns user preferences based on **historical interactions and interests**.  
   - **Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) or Focal Loss** is used to optimize the model and handle class imbalance issues.  
   - Overfitting is managed by **regularization techniques** and **dataset augmentation**.  

3. **Making Recommendations**  
   - When a user requests recommendations, the trained model predicts **relevance scores** for available courses.  
   - The system sorts the courses and returns the **Top 5 most relevant** ones.  

## Real-World Applications  
### **1. Learning Platforms (MOOCs & LMS)**  
   - The system helps students **find the right courses** based on their learning interests.  
   - It reduces the time needed to search for relevant courses.  

### **2. Adaptive Learning**  
   - It personalizes learning paths for students by suggesting additional materials related to their enrolled courses.  

### **3. Career Development**  
   - It recommends skill-based learning programs tailored to users' **career aspirations**.  

## Challenges & Solutions  
| **Challenge** | **Solution** |  
|--------------|-------------|  
| Overfitting on small datasets | Used **regularization & data augmentation** |  
| Course category imbalance | Used **Focal Loss** instead of BCE |  
| Cold Start Problem (new users) | Used **explicit user profiles** & **popular course recommendations** |  
| Slow recommendation generation | **Optimized tensor operations** to speed up predictions |  

## Future Improvements  
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combine **collaborative filtering & content-based filtering** for better recommendations.  
- **Multi-source Data Integration**: Incorporate user **search history, clicks, and ratings** to enhance accuracy.  
- **Explainable AI**: Provide users with **explanations** on why a course is recommended.  

## Conclusion  
This model has the potential to **revolutionize digital education** by making learning more accessible and **personalized**. By leveraging **deep learning, embeddings, and TF-IDF**, we can build a **powerful, scalable** recommendation system that **adapts to user needs** in real time.
